Computational Optimization for Learning and Adaptive Systems (COLA) laboratory is working in computational/artificial intelligence, multi-objective optimization and decision-making, operational research, machine learning and statistical modeling of complex systems. Applications focus on search-based software engineering, energy, biological science and medicine.

{{< hint info >}}
We are constantly looking for _talented_ and _passionate_ people to join our lab. Please refer to [vacancies](/docs/home/vacancies) for potential opportunities.<br>

* Our tutorial on "Preference-Based Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization: Steppingstone to Involve Human in the Loop" has been accepted to IEEE [CEC 2023](https://2023.ieee-cec.org/) and [SMC 2023](https://ieeesmc2023.org/). This is an emerging topic that has been explored in my group for more than five years. It is my pleasure to share with you some of our very recent advances along this direction. Look forward seeing you in Chicago and Hawaii.<i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> March 3

* My paper on "Batched Data-Driven Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization Based on Manifold Interpolation" published in IEEE Tran. Evolutionary Computation this year has been invited to give a Journal to Conference talk in IEEE [CEC 2023](https://2023.ieee-cec.org/).

Computational Optimization for Learning and Adaptive Systems (COLA) laboratory has contributed the fundamental development of computational/artificial intelligence (CI/AI) for black-box optimization and decision-making (especially with multiple conflicting objectives), as well as applications in life sciences (including bioscience and healthcare) and software engineering. In particular, we have been enthusiastic about broad AI+X (integrating AI with application domains denoted by "X" to enhance, innovate, or transform the domain).

{{< hint info >}}
We are constantly looking for _talented_ and _passionate_ people to join our lab. Please refer to [vacancies](/docs/home/vacancies) for potential opportunities.

- We have three paper accepted to [AAAI 2026](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/) Main Track. In particular, Tianmeng's is selected as an Oral paper (top 5\% of over 31,000 submissions). His paper provides a very interesting theoretical discussion of a ‘well-known’ criterion (reinforcing monotonicity constraints) in multi-agent reinforcement learning. He challenged this domain and discovered that non-monotonic value decomposition can be ‘surprisingly’ good for learning dynamics. Very very congratulations to Tianmeng, Shengbo and Fan! <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> Nov 8

- Our paper on "Assessing Automated Fact-Checking for Medical LLM Responses with Knowledge Graphs" has been accepted to [AAAI 2026](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/) AISI Track. This paper develops a framework to evaluate the factuality of LLMs for medical QA. Very important work for our lab in the direction of agentic AI, which is going to be part of strategic direction that will be a high level framework to connect our models, algorithms and more. Congratulations to Shasha, Mingyu, and Jack. Very well done! <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> Nov 4

- Our paper on [Augmenting Biological Fitness Prediction Benchmarks with Landscapes Features from GraphFLA](/posts/NeurIPS25_MH_GraphFLA) has been accepted to NeurIPS 2025 as a spotlight. This is a novel perspective to view performance benchmarking in biological machine learning models. By systematically considering the interplay of fitness landscape features of the biological system, we develop a new framework to benchmark performance beyond accuracy. Congratulations to Mingyu who has been working on the fitness landscape analysis direction for years. Looking forward to generating more interesting results along this line in the coming years. <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> Sep 18

- Our paper on "Multi-Fidelity Methods for Optimization: A Survey" has been accepted to ACM Computing Surveys. Congratulations to Fan who has contributed significantly and supported me in this survey. Multi-fidelity method is a classic optimization paradigm, which has been widely studied and applied in engineering domain, particularly aerodynamics etc. However, my philosophy is everything can be made multi-fidelity while it is pretty much like a problem-solving paradigm. It is super interesting direction to exploit and hopefully we will have new talented students jumping into this field in near future. Congratulations once again to Fan! <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> Jul 30

- I'm happy to announce that our proposal to host the 2027 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), the flagship conference in the field of evolutionary computation and computational intelligence, has been officially approved by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. This IEEE CEC 2027 will be located in Edinburgh at the summer of 2027. Looking forward to seeing you guys there and I believe it will be a very interesting event in computational intelligence. <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> Jul 28

- As a Co-PI, I am honored to be in the team of a Faraday Discovery Fellowship led by Prof. Yiliang Ding at the John Innes Centre. This is a massive &pound;8million investment in unveiling the RNA language in nature. My lab has been collaborating with Yiliang since 2020. Both of us know how hard it is to carry out such highly interdisciplinary research. Looking forward to working with Yiliang on building an truly ambitious AI for RNA biology programme in the next 10 years. Congratulations once again to Yiliang and the team! <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> Jul 25

-  Our proposal on Large Language Model Empowered Explainable Automated Machine Learning for Early Diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease has been approved for funding by an EPSRC-IAA Impact Visionary Award.

# Welcome to Ke Li's Homepage

We are a research laboratory based in Exeter. Our research expertise is in computational/artificial intelligence, multi-objective optimisation and decision-making, operational research, machine learning. Applications focus on search-based software engineering, water engineering, material science and medicine.

{{< hint info >}}
We are constantly looking for _talented_ and _passionate_ people to join our lab. Please refer to [vacancies](/docs/home/vacancies) for potential opportunities.<br>
<ins>**Now PhD studentships for 2021 entry are available for application!!!**<ins>

{{< tab "Apr" >}}

* Glad to serve as a PC member of [PPSN 2020](https://ppsn2020.liacs.leidenuniv.nl/). `Apr 20`

* Our paper "DeepSQLi: Deep Semantic Learning for Testing SQL Injection" has been accepted to [ISSTA 2020](https://conf.researchr.org/home/issta-2020) as a full paper (acceptance rate is 43/162 = 26.5%). We have developed a revolutionary view of taking advantage of the semantic information embedded in SQL injection cases. Thereafter, we use a state-of-the-art natural language processing tool to learn such semantic information and use that to automate the test case generation. More details will be released in our project page. `Apr 15`

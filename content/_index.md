# Welcome to Ke Li's Homepage

We are a research laboratory based in Exeter. Our research expertise is in computational/artificial intelligence, multi-objective optimisation and decision-making, operational research, machine learning. Applications focus on search-based software engineering, water engineering, material science and medicine.

{{< hint info >}}
We are constantly looking for _talented_ and _passionate_ people to join our lab. Please refer to [vacancies](/docs/home/vacancies) for potential opportunities.<br>

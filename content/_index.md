Computational Optimization for Learning and Adaptive Systems (COLA) laboratory is working in computational/artificial intelligence, multi-objective optimization and decision-making, operational research, machine learning and statistical modeling of complex systems. Applications focus on search-based software engineering, energy, biological science and medicine.

## <i class='fa fa-twitch' style='font-size:19px'></i> Recent News (Year 2024)

{{< tabs "uniqueid" >}}

{{< tab "Oct" >}}
* Our paper "An Interpretable RNA Foundation Model for Exploration Functional RNA Motifs in Plants" has been accepted to Nature Machine Intelligence. This is the world first RNA foundation model pre-trained for the plant kingdom. While we only has 35 million parameters, this model can already beat other much larger models. Very appreciate to our student Heng's hard work as well as our fantastic collaborators Haopeng and Yiliang in the John Innes Centre. Without this highly multi-disciplinary collaboration, we cannot achieve this far. There are many more follow-on works coming soon! <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> October 16

{{< tab "Sep" >}}

* Our paper "Direct Preference-Based Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization with Dueling Bandits" has been accepted to [NeruIPS 2024](https://neurips.cc/). This is a super cool paper that achieves the first theoretical results of dueling bandits in multi-objective optimization. In particular, we significantly reduce the query complexity. Congratulations to Tian and Shengbo! <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> September 25

* We have two papers been accepted in [EMNLP 2024](https://2024.emnlp.org/). One is about adversarial defense in large language models while the other is about using language model to predict RNA secondary structure. Both of them are very cool, especially the RNA one. Congratulations to Heng! <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> September 19

* I'm honored to be recognized in the list of top 2% of the world most-cited scientists by [Stanford University](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7). I have been in this list since 2020. Really appreciate the hard work from my students and collaborators. <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> September 19

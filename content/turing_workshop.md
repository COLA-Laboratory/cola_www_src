## <i class='fa fa-quote-left' style='font-size:20px'></i> Synopsis

Human-Centered artificial/computational intelligence (HCAI/CI) is an emerging discipline intent on creating AI/CI systems that amplify and augment rather than displace human abilities. Instead, HCAI/CI seeks to preserve human control in a way that ensures AI meets our needs while also operating in a reliable, robust, and transparent manner, delivering equitable outcomes, and respecting privacy. 

This workshop is designed to bring key data scientists and AI experts from both academia and industry to sharing up to date research and innovation developments themed on HCAI/CI, but also help identify the key challenges in stakeholders. We anticipate this workshop playing as the springboard to explore potential collaboration between academics and with industrial stakeholders. It will take place as part of the outreach activities of the Alan Turing Institute and the Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the University of Exeter (partnering with the University of Oxford and the University of Birmingham). Both institutes are actively developing and fostering a culture of effective interactions for promoting data science and AI for addressing global challenges across disciplines.


## <i class='fa fa-quote-left' style='font-size:20px'></i> Objectives

We want to leverage this workshop as a driver to develop an emerging area related to human-centric C/AI and raise the awareness of the Alan Turing Institute nationally and internationally in the forefront of AI/CI.
- Promote the inter-disciplinary knowledge exchange and conversation between academics and industrial stakeholders themed on the HCAI/CI approaches for engineering, scientific and public sectors.
- Identify the key challenges and opportunities of bringing human in the loop of AI and CI as well as their uptake in the real world.
- Promote and explore the potential collaboration across different universities and with industry.

## Objectives

Data has been playing an ever-growing role in artificial/computational intelligence. Such role goes beyond its typical use in neural networks and learning systems, encompassing also evolutionary and other meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The objective of this symposium is to provide a unique and vibrant cohort for sharing and experiencing the emerging methodologies and applications of data-driven artificial/computational intelligence. It will offer keynotes, invited lectures and discussion groups given by experts from Exeter, Leiden and other high-profile institutions. It will provide a unique opportunity for participants to 1) learn about artificial/computational intelligence approaches and their applications; 2) interact with world-renowned experts in computational intelligence; and 3) communicate with experts and peers with a broad range of backgrounds to exchange ideas and form new collaborations.

## Venue
Given the COVID-19 global pandemic, this symposium will be running in an online format. It will take place as part of the outreach activities of the Alan Turing Institute and the Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the University of Exeter. Both institutes are actively developing and fostering a culture of effective interactions for promoting data science and AI for addressing global challenges across disciplines.

<i class='fa fa-bullhorn' style='font-size:16px'></i> **Bayesian Optimisation and Input Uncertainty Reduction**<br>
<i class='fa fa-wpforms' style='font-size:16px'></i> <ins>Abstract</ins>: Simulators often require calibration inputs estimated from real world data and the  estimate can significantly affect simulation output. Particularly when performing simulation optimisation to find an optimal solution, the uncertainty in the inputs significantly affects the quality of the found solution. One remedy is to search for the solution that has the best performance on average over the uncertain range of inputs yielding an optimal compromise solution. We consider the more general setting where a user may choose between either running simulations or instead querying an external data source, improving the input estimate and enabling the search for a more targeted, less compromised solution. We explicitly examine the trade-off between simulation and real data collection in order to find the optimal solution of the simulator with the true inputs. Using a value of information procedure, we propose a novel unified simulation optimisation procedure called Bayesian Information Collection and Optimisation (BICO) that, in each iteration, automatically determines which of the two actions (running simulations or data collection) is more beneficial. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to automatically determine an appropriate balance between optimisation and data collection.<br>

<i class='fa fa-bullhorn' style='font-size:16px'></i> **Perspectives to Data-driven Multiobjective Optimization with Interactive Methods**<br>
<i class='fa fa-wpforms' style='font-size:16px'></i> <ins>Abstract</ins>: In data analytics, we can use descriptive analytics to understand the data or predictive analytics to make predictions, but to know what actions to take to reach desired outcomes, we need prescriptive analytics. To make optimized recommendations or decisions based on the data, we can fit models in the data and derive optimization problems. In many cases, real decisions to be made are characterized by multiple conflicting objectives to be optimized and we can support decision making by applying appropriate multiobjective optimization methods. This we can call decision analytics.<br>
In this talk, I discuss different elements of a seamless chain from data to data-driven decision support involving multiobjective optimization. Eventually, the derived multiobjective optimization problem is solved with an appropriate interactive method. In that way, the decision maker with domain expertise can augment information contained in the data and direct the solution process with one’s preferences. At the same time, the decision maker gains insight into the interdependencies and trade-offs among the conflicting objectives, and can get convinced of the quality of the most preferred solution. In addition, I give some examples of data-driven decision making problems. Finally, I give an overview of the modular, open-source software framework DESDEO containing different interactive methods.

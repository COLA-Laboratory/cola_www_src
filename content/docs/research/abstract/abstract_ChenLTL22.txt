Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been recognized as a promising approach for bilevel optimization. However, the population-based characteristic of EAs largely influences their efficiency and effectiveness due to the nested structure of the two levels of optimization problems. In this article, we propose a transfer learning-based parallel EA (TLEA) framework for bilevel optimization. In this framework, the task of optimizing a set of lower level problems parameterized by upper level variables is conducted in a parallel manner. In the meanwhile, a transfer learning strategy is developed to improve the effectiveness of each lower level search (LLS) process. In practice, we implement two versions of the TLEA: the first version uses the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy and the second version uses the differential evolution as the evolutionary operator in lower level optimization. The experimental studies on two sets of widely used bilevel optimization benchmark problems are conducted, and the performance of the two TLEA implementations is compared to that of four well-established evolutionary bilevel optimization algorithms to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm framework.

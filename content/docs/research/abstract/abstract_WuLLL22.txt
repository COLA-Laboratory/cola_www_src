This article proposes a controlling framework for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to integrate the modes of formation flight and swarm deployment over fixed and switching topologies. Formation strategies enable UAVs to enjoy key collective benefits including reduced energy consumption, but the shape of the formation and each UAV's freedom are significantly restrained. Swarm strategies are thus proposed to maximize each UAV's freedom following simple yet powerful rules. This article investigates the integration and switch between these two strategies, considering the deployment environment factors, such as poor network conditions and unknown and often highly mobile obstacles. We design a distributed formation controller to guide multiple UAVs in orderless states to swiftly reach an intended formation. Inspired by starling birds and similar biological creatures, a distributed collision avoidance controller is proposed to avoid unknown and mobile obstacles. We further illustrated the stability of the controllers over both fixed and switching topologies. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the framework.

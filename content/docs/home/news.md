* Our paper “Adaptive Operator Selection Based on Dynamic Thompson Sampling for MOEA/D” has been accepted to [PPSN 2020](https://ppsn2020.liacs.leidenuniv.nl/) for oral presentation. Congratulations to Lei! `May 27`

* Congratulations to my students Phoenix Williams who win an competitive [EPSRC DTP Studentship](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/pg-research/money/phdfunding/fundedcentres/epsrcdtp/) and Jiancheng Qian who wins the [China Scholarship Council and University of Exeter PhD Scholarship](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/pg-research/money/phdfunding/chinascholarship/). Both of them will join my lab this September. Phoenix previous worked with me under the support of EPSRC Vacation Internship last summer. `May 13`

* Glad to serve as a PC member of [PPSN 2020](https://ppsn2020.liacs.leidenuniv.nl/). `Apr 20`

* Our paper "DeepSQLi: Deep Semantic Learning for Testing SQL Injection" has been accepted to [ISSTA 2020](https://conf.researchr.org/home/issta-2020) as a full paper (acceptance rate is 43/162 = 26.5%). We have developed a revolutionary view of taking advantage of the semantic information embedded in SQL injection cases. Thereafter, we use a state-of-the-art natural language processing tool to learn such semantic information and use that to automate the test case generation. More details will be released in our project page. `Apr 15`

* Our paper "Surrogate Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm for Medium Scale Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems" has been accepted to [GECCO 2020](https://gecco-2020.sigevo.org/index.html/HomePage) as a full paper. We provide a new framework to scale up the surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm for problems with up to 50 variables. `Mar 20`

* Our paper "Routing-Led Placement of VNFs in Arbitrary Networks" and "Surrogate Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Transfer Learning for Dynamic Expensive Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems" have been accepted to [WCCI 2020](https://wcci2020.org/) as full papers. `Mar 20`

* Our paper "Does Preference Always Help? A Holistic Study on Preference-Based Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimisation Using Reference Points" has been accepted to IEEE Trans. Evolutionary Computation. We have several interesting findings first of their kind reported in this study. Project page will be released soon and please stay tuned to our latest information. `Mar 17`

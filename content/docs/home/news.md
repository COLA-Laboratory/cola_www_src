- Our 3D RNA inverse dsign paper accepted to [ICLR 2026](https://iclr.cc/). Instead of chasing the sequence recovery rate, Tianmeng proposed new reinforcement learning guided alignment strategy that significantly improve the performance of inverse designed sequences that can be folded into the target structure. Structure matters! <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> Jan 26

- We have three paper accepted to [AAAI 2026](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/) Main Track. In particular, Tianmeng's is selected as an Oral paper (top 5\% of over 31,000 submissions). His paper provides a very interesting theoretical discussion of a ‘well-known’ criterion (reinforcing monotonicity constraints) in multi-agent reinforcement learning. He challenged this domain and discovered that non-monotonic value decomposition can be ‘surprisingly’ good for learning dynamics. Very very congratulations to Tianmeng, Shengbo and Fan! <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> Nov 8

- Our paper on "Assessing Automated Fact-Checking for Medical LLM Responses with Knowledge Graphs" has been accepted to [AAAI 2026](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/) AISI Track. This paper develops a framework to evaluate the factuality of LLMs for medical QA.

* Our paper "Rethinking Performance Analysis for Configurable Software Systems: A Case Study from a Fitness Landscape Perspective" has been accepted to [ISSTA 2025](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/). This is another line of our hardcore endeavour towards fitness landscape analysis for highly complex black-box systems. Our KDD 2025 work is about the machine learning system, while this work is about configurable software systems. This is a really intriguing area and we are moving towards building a software platform to facilitate and scale up such analysis to any black-boxes, such as biological systems where the fitness landscapes are from. Note that we ranked as the top 4% (23 out of 553 submissions) papers that are accepted in the first round. Very well done, Mingyu! <i class='fa fa-calendar' style='font-size:19px'></i> December 19

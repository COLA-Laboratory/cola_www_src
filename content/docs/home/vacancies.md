{{< tab "Visiting Scholar" >}}

We are also welcome the self-funded visiting scholars (supported by CSC or other government organisations) to join the COLA Laboratory. Note that I prefer at most host 3 long-term (at least one year) visitors simultaneously in order to allocate enough supervision time.

Data-driven optimization has received increased interest over the past decade due to its practical importance in many industrial sectors and scientific research fields. Little attention, however, has been paid to privacy preservation the data used for optimization. This talk presents our recent work on privacy-preserving data-driven evolutionary optimization based on federated learning techniques and infill criteria. The prosed framework is applicable to both single- and multi-objective optimization.

The paper to discuss is announced about one week in advance by the presenter. All participants are expected to read the paper before the meeting. It is recommended to take notes about insights, questions, and other points potentially worth discussions.

The goals of the reading group are:
- Critical reflection on scientific work
- Practice of reading and argumentation strategies
- Exposure to a broad range of research topics
- Practice of leading group discussions

The discussion is usually limited to one hour. The presenter will kick off the meeting by giving a short summary of the paper and raising a few points for discussion. The present is expected to inspire participants into the discussion.

However, the bibtex sources can be messy in the wild. Here are some useful tips to prepare a beautiful and clean bibtex file.\n Instead of searching from Google, it might be more convenient to search the corresponding paper or author in DBLP. There is an option to choose the export record as the BibTeX. It will be more efficient to use some text editor like Vim to facilitate your editing. However, there is a steep learning curve to manage the Vim. Be careful to include unnecessary components in your bib. For example, it will take extra space if you include url and doi. Note that most publishers have a strict rule on the page length. If the corresponding paper is not published yet, i.e., just accepted or in press, there is usually NO pages, volume and number related information. Instead, we just need to amend a note component in the bibtex: note={accepted for publication}.  In the following paragraphs, we mainly focus on three types of publications to give you some tangible examples.\nJournal article\nLet us use the following example from one of my papers to explain the format.\n@article{LiZKLW14, author = {Ke Li and Qingfu Zhang and Sam Kwong and Miqing Li and Ran Wang}, title = {Stable Matching-Based Selection in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization}, journal = {{IEEE} Trans. Evol. Comput.}, volume = {18}, number = {6}, pages = {909--923}, year = {2014}, doi = {10.1109/TEVC.2013.2293776}, timestamp = {Mon, 27 Nov 2017 16:55:26 +0100}, biburl = {http://dblp.org/rec/bib/journals/tec/LiZKLW14}, bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org} } Most components can be directly obtained from the paper itself. We only explicitly explain the following components.\n bibtex entry ABC:  A: The last name of the first author, e.g., \u0026ldquo;A = Li\u0026rdquo; in this example. B: The first letter of each of the other authors, e.g., \u0026ldquo;B = ZKLW\u0026rdquo; in this example. C: Shortcut of the publication year, e.g., \u0026ldquo;C = 14\u0026rdquo; in this example.   title: Please capitalize each word in the paper title, except for some conjunction words or so. journal: Please try to use the abbreviation of the journal name as much as you can. You can easily Google this information. Alternatively, you can refer to the relevant publisher for detailed information. pages: Please use double hyphens to connect the page numbers. doi, timestamp, biburl and bibsource are not always necessary. But you can find more information from the DBLP of the corresponding author(s).  If the paper is not published yet, the bibtex will be simplified as follows.\n@article{LiNGY21, author = {Ke Li and Haifeng Nie and Huiru Gao and Xin Yao}, title = {Posterior Decision-Making Based on Decomposition-Driven Knee Point Identification}, journal = {{IEEE} Trans. Evol. Comput.}, year = {2021}, note = {accepted for publication} }  Conference article\nConference paper is slightly different from the journal article. It is usually published as a proceeding thus there is no issue or volume number. Instead, we usually need to formulate the name of the proceeding. Sometimes the editors are required to be listed, but I usually recommend to omit that part. Let us use the following example to explain this format.\n@inproceedings{WuKJLZ17, author = {Mengyuan Wu and Sam Kwong and Yuheng Jia and Ke Li and Qingfu Zhang}, title = {Adaptive weights generation for decomposition-based multi-objective optimization using Gaussian process regression}, booktitle = {GECCO'17: Proc. of the 2017 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference}, pages = {641--648}, publisher = {{ACM}}, year = {2017}, timestamp = {Fri, 27 Mar 2020 09:03:02 +0100}, biburl = {https://dblp.org/rec/conf/gecco/WuKJLZ17.bib}, bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org} } The other rules are almost the same as the journal article, except the following components.\n booktitle is formulated as: S'Y: Proc. of the xxxx Conference on  S: Abbreviation of the conference, e.g., \u0026ldquo;S = GECCO\u0026rdquo; in this example. Y: Shortcut of the conference year, e.g., \u0026ldquo;Y = 17\u0026rdquo; in this example. xxxx: conference year, e.g., \u0026ldquo;xxxx = 2017\u0026rdquo; in this example.     Book\nBook is a bit different from the journal and conference papers. Most components can be directly derived from the book itself. You can apply the previous formats here. Let us use the following example to explain this format.\n@book{Deb01, author = {Kalyanmoy Deb}, title = {Multi-Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms}, publisher = {John Wiley \\\u0026amp; Sons, Inc.}, address = {New York, NY, USA}, year = {2001} }  Technical report\n@techreport{ABC, author = {xx and xx}, title = {xx}, institution = {xx}, year = {xxxx} }  ArXiv paper\n@article{Frazier18, author = {Peter I.

It contains icons for websites and organisations related to academia that are often missing from mainstream font packages. It can be used by itself, but its primary purpose is to be used as a supplementary package alongside a larger icon set. Go here to view the full icon set along with instructions for their use.\nRequesting new icons #  New icons can be requested by creating an issue here. Before submitting a request, please check that the following conditions are satisfied:\n  The organisation in question is already using a logo/icon of appropriate dimensions (roughly square). If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, then there\u0026rsquo;s really not much that can be done, and the request will have to be ignored until such time that a logo/icon can be provided.\n  An icon of appropriate resolution can be provided or linked to. Ideally, the provided file will be a vector file (e.g. SVG, EPS, AI) or a PDF with the vector file embedded. These files are all very easy to work with, and result in the most faithful reproductions of the icon. Altenatively, high resolution raster images (e.g. JPEG, PNG, GIF) can work, but only if the resolution is high enough that the underlying shapes can be reproduced. Icons made from raster images take much longer to prepare, and require hand drawing each component and figuring out the exact typeface used for any letters. This process can be rather tedious, and I will only do this if there is significant demand for the icon. Favicon files can be useful in conjunction with larger logos that have non-ideal aspect ratios—where they can indicate which part of the logo to strip down to—but they are pretty much useless by themselves. The only time I have made an icon from a favicon was for arXiv, and that was only because: (i) It was heavily requested, and (ii) I was able to get feedback on the new icon from Paul Ginsparg, who made the original icon. You can still submit the request, but it will likely be ignored until someone else comes along and provides the file we need.\n  The icon can be reduced to monochrome. This is one of the basic requirements of a versatile icon, but it is often overlooked when icons are made by people who are not professional designers. Academia is full of unprofessional designers, and it is sometimes the case that a logo relies entirely on the use of different colours. In certain cases we can be creative (see the dblp logo), but more often than not it will be impossible to create a monochrome version of the icon. Again, feel free to make the request, but it will probably be ignored if an alternate logo cannot be found.\n  License #   The Academicons font is licensed under the SIL OFL 1.1:   http://scripts.sil.org/OFL   Academicons CSS, LESS, and SASS files are licensed under the MIT License:   http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html   The Academicons documentation is licensed under the CC BY 3.0 License:   http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/    Author #   GitHub: https://github.com/jpswalsh Web: http://jpswalsh.com  "}),a.add({id:4,href:'/docs/research/archive_reading/',title:"Archive Reading",section:"Docs",content:"Archive of Reading Group #  Agenda (Year 2020) #  Dec   Surrogate Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms, Fan Li Dec 27\n[slides]\n  RoboGrammar: Graph Grammar for Terrain-Optimized Robot Design, ACM Trans.

Decomposition-based techniques have been widely used for solving both single- and multi-objective optimization problems. More specifically, in single-objective optimization, especially for the large-scale scenarios, which consider a tremendous amount of decision variables, the decomposition-based technique contains three aspects: 1) analyzing and understanding the fitness landscape and modularity structure of the underlying problem; 2) decomposing the original complex problem into several loosely coupled or independent subproblems based on the learnt characteristics; 3) using a meta-heuristic to solve these subproblems in a sequential or concurrent manner. As for multi-objective optimization, the decomposition means to decompose the original multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single-objective optimization sub-problems (or simple multi-objective optimization problems) and then uses a meta-heuristic to optimize these sub-problems simultaneously and collaboratively. In this big data era, the decomposition-based techniques used for both single- and multi-objective optimization can be sythesized to address the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality, i.e., many objectives and large scale variables.\nThe key objective of this task force it to generalize the decomposition-based idea and to promote its related research, including its development, education and understanding of its sub topic areas.\nThe main objectives of the task force can be summarized as follows:\n create an active and healthy community to promote theme areas of decomposition-based techniques make student, researchers, end-users, developers, and consultants aware of the state-of-the-art promote the use of decomposition-based methodologies/techniques and tools organize conferences/workshop with IEEE CIS Technical Co-Sponsorship organize tutorials, workshops and special sessions launch edited volumes, books, and special issues in journals  Anticipated Interests #  This task force will focus on all aspects, including theory, practice and applications, of the decomposition-based technique in evolutionary computation for solving both single-, multi- and many-objective optimization problems.

The objective of this symposium is to provide a unique and vibrant cohort for sharing and experiencing the emerging methodologies and applications of data-driven artificial/computational intelligence. It will offer keynotes, invited lectures and discussion groups given by experts from Exeter, Leiden and other high-profile institutions. It will provide a unique opportunity for participants to 1) learn about artificial/computational intelligence approaches and their applications; 2) interact with world-renowned experts in computational intelligence; and 3) communicate with experts and peers with a broad range of backgrounds to exchange ideas and form new collaborations.\n Venue #  Given the COVID-19 global pandemic, this symposium will be running in an online format. It will take place as part of the outreach activities of the Alan Turing Institute and the Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the University of Exeter. Both institutes are actively developing and fostering a culture of effective interactions for promoting data science and AI for addressing global challenges across disciplines.\n Schedule #  The symposium will be organized in one day with the following agenda:\n 9:00 – 9:10: Introduction talk by Ke Li/Hao Wang    9:10 – 10:00: TBD\n Michael Emmerich |  Abstract @article{LiLY22, author = {Ke Li and Guiyu Lai and Xin Yao}, title = {Interactive Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization via Learning-to-Rank}, journal = {CoRR}, volume = {abs/2204.02604}, year = {2022}, url = {https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2204.02604}, doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2204.02604}, eprinttype = {arXiv}, eprint = {2204.02604}, timestamp = {Tue, 12 Apr 2022 18:42:14 +0200}, biburl = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2204-02604.bib}, bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org} }    10:00 – 10:50: TBD\n Yaochu Jin |  Abstract @article{LiLY22, author = {Ke Li and Guiyu Lai and Xin Yao}, title = {Interactive Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization via Learning-to-Rank}, journal = {CoRR}, volume = {abs/2204.02604}, year = {2022}, url = {https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2204.02604}, doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2204.02604}, eprinttype = {arXiv}, eprint = {2204.02604}, timestamp = {Tue, 12 Apr 2022 18:42:14 +0200}, biburl = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2204-02604.bib}, bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org} }    10:50 – 11:40: TBD\n Thomas Bäck |  Abstract @article{LiLY22, author = {Ke Li and Guiyu Lai and Xin Yao}, title = {Interactive Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization via Learning-to-Rank}, journal = {CoRR}, volume = {abs/2204.02604}, year = {2022}, url = {https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2204.02604}, doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2204.02604}, eprinttype = {arXiv}, eprint = {2204.02604}, timestamp = {Tue, 12 Apr 2022 18:42:14 +0200}, biburl = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2204-02604.bib}, bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org} }    11:40 – 14:00: Lunch break    14:00 – 14:50 | Prof. Juergen Branke\n Bayesian Optimisation and Input Uncertainty Reduction\n Abstract: Simulators often require calibration inputs estimated from real world data and the estimate can significantly affect simulation output. Particularly when performing simulation optimisation to find an optimal solution, the uncertainty in the inputs significantly affects the quality of the found solution. One remedy is to search for the solution that has the best performance on average over the uncertain range of inputs yielding an optimal compromise solution. We consider the more general setting where a user may choose between either running simulations or instead querying an external data source, improving the input estimate and enabling the search for a more targeted, less compromised solution. We explicitly examine the trade-off between simulation and real data collection in order to find the optimal solution of the simulator with the true inputs. Using a value of information procedure, we propose a novel unified simulation optimisation procedure called Bayesian Information Collection and Optimisation (BICO) that, in each iteration, automatically determines which of the two actions (running simulations or data collection) is more beneficial. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to automatically determine an appropriate balance between optimisation and data collection.\n    14:50 – 15:40 | Prof. Kaisa Mittenen\n Perspectives to Data-driven Multiobjective Optimization with Interactive Methods\n Abstract: In data analytics, we can use descriptive analytics to understand the data or predictive analytics to make predictions, but to know what actions to take to reach desired outcomes, we need prescriptive analytics. To make optimized recommendations or decisions based on the data, we can fit models in the data and derive optimization problems. In many cases, real decisions to be made are characterized by multiple conflicting objectives to be optimized and we can support decision making by applying appropriate multiobjective optimization methods. This we can call decision analytics.\nIn this talk, I discuss different elements of a seamless chain from data to data-driven decision support involving multiobjective optimization. Eventually, the derived multiobjective optimization problem is solved with an appropriate interactive method. In that way, the decision maker with domain expertise can augment information contained in the data and direct the solution process with one’s preferences. At the same time, the decision maker gains insight into the interdependencies and trade-offs among the conflicting objectives, and can get convinced of the quality of the most preferred solution. In addition, I give some examples of data-driven decision making problems. Finally, I give an overview of the modular, open-source software framework DESDEO containing different interactive methods.    15:40 – 16:55\n Panel discussion    16:55 – 17:00: Closing remark  "}),a.add({id:16,href:'/docs/home/vacancies/',title:"Vacancies",section:"Docs",content:"Vacancies #    We very much welcome and support applications from underrepresented groups and from people of all shapes, shades, and genders.

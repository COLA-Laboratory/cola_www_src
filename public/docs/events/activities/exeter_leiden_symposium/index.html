<p>Data has been playing an ever-growing role in artificial/computational intelligence. Such role goes beyond its typical use in neural networks and learning systems, encompassing also evolutionary and other meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The objective of this symposium is to provide a unique and vibrant cohort for sharing and experiencing the emerging methodologies and applications of data-driven artificial/computational intelligence. It will offer keynotes, invited lectures and discussion groups given by experts from Exeter, Leiden and other high-profile institutions. It will provide a unique opportunity for participants to 1) learn about artificial/computational intelligence approaches and their applications; 2) interact with world-renowned experts in computational intelligence; and 3) communicate with experts and peers with a broad range of backgrounds to exchange ideas and form new collaborations.</p>
<p>It will take place as part of the outreach activities of the Alan Turing Institute and the Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the University of Exeter. Both institutes are actively developing and fostering a culture of effective interactions for promoting data science and AI for addressing global challenges across disciplines.</p>

<pre class="bibtexpre" id="me" style="display: none;">
The quantification of uncertainty is an important topic when it comes to modeling function landscapes based on previously evaluated input-output pairs. Gaussian process regression and the closely related Kriging method form allegedly the most well known class of surrogate models supporting uncertainty quantification. Here the uncertainty stems from the assumption that outputs are correlated by means of a distance (in the input-space) dependent correlation function. Such knowledge can be used to compute probabilistic confidence bounds to quantify uncertainty of predictions. Lipschitz continuity (and the more general Hölder continuity) on the other hand makes assumptions about bounded change rates. It, too, is based on distances in the input space but its model assumptions yield deterministic upper and lower bounds for the uncertainty ranges in prediction tasks.<br>
We contrast these two techniques and reveal commonalities and differences and also comment on their usefulness in the integration to (multiobjective) Bayesian optimization frameworks. A special focus will be on variants of expected improvements and show that the use of a Lipschitzian interpretation of the Expected Improvement is almost equivalent to Shubert's algorithm  Computations in the Lipschitzian case are far easier and more efficient while many of the interesting properties of Gaussian process models are preserved.

Data-driven optimization has received increased interest over the past decade due to its practical importance in many industrial sectors and scientific research fields. Little attention, however, has been paid to privacy preservation the data used for optimization. This talk presents our recent work on privacy-preserving data-driven evolutionary optimization based on federated learning techniques and infill criteria. The prosed framework is applicable to both single- and multi-objective optimization.

Direct global optimization algorithms based on evolutionary computation have shown big successes in a wide range of application domains, for example engineering design optimization.<br>
In machine learning, the optimization of hyperparameters (also called the algorithm configuration problem) is an important task. I will briefly explain this problem and provide some examples illustrating that this task can be handled by direct global optimization algorithms as well. While algorithm configuration is commonly applied to machine learning algorithms, algorithm configuration for evolution strategies is also an exciting application domain. I will give a simple example how a combinatorial design space of 4608 configuration variants of evolution strategies can be explored and investigated using data mining. This approach provides an opportunity for discovering the unexplored areas of the optimization algorithm design space. Conversely, direct global optimization methods can also be used as algorithm configurators, or even for addressing the combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization (CASH) task in machine learning. I will provide some insight into research in this direction, too.<br>
To conclude, I return to real world application examples and illustrate a few of those that my group worked on, over the past more than 20 years.

<pre class="bibtexpre" id="jb" style="display: none;">
Simulators often require calibration inputs estimated from real world data and the  estimate can significantly affect simulation output. Particularly when performing simulation optimisation to find an optimal solution, the uncertainty in the inputs significantly affects the quality of the found solution. One remedy is to search for the solution that has the best performance on average over the uncertain range of inputs yielding an optimal compromise solution. We consider the more general setting where a user may choose between either running simulations or instead querying an external data source, improving the input estimate and enabling the search for a more targeted, less compromised solution. We explicitly examine the trade-off between simulation and real data collection in order to find the optimal solution of the simulator with the true inputs. Using a value of information procedure, we propose a novel unified simulation optimisation procedure called Bayesian Information Collection and Optimisation (BICO) that, in each iteration, automatically determines which of the two actions (running simulations or data collection) is more beneficial. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to automatically determine an appropriate balance between optimisation and data collection.

<pre class="bibtexpre" id="km" style="display: none;">
In data analytics, we can use descriptive analytics to understand the data or predictive analytics to make predictions, but to know what actions to take to reach desired outcomes, we need prescriptive analytics. To make optimized recommendations or decisions based on the data, we can fit models in the data and derive optimization problems. In many cases, real decisions to be made are characterized by multiple conflicting objectives to be optimized and we can support decision making by applying appropriate multiobjective optimization methods. This we can call decision analytics.<br>
In this talk, I discuss different elements of a seamless chain from data to data-driven decision support involving multiobjective optimization. Eventually, the derived multiobjective optimization problem is solved with an appropriate interactive method. In that way, the decision maker with domain expertise can augment information contained in the data and direct the solution process with one’s preferences. At the same time, the decision maker gains insight into the interdependencies and trade-offs among the conflicting objectives, and can get convinced of the quality of the most preferred solution. In addition, I give some examples of data-driven decision making problems. Finally, I give an overview of the modular, open-source software framework DESDEO containing different interactive methods.

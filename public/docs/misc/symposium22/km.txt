In data analytics, we can use descriptive analytics to understand the data or predictive analytics to make predictions, but to know what actions to take to reach desired outcomes, we need prescriptive analytics. To make optimized recommendations or decisions based on the data, we can fit models in the data and derive optimization problems. In many cases, real decisions to be made are characterized by multiple conflicting objectives to be optimized and we can support decision making by applying appropriate multiobjective optimization methods. This we can call decision analytics.<br>
In this talk, I discuss different elements of a seamless chain from data to data-driven decision support involving multiobjective optimization. Eventually, the derived multiobjective optimization problem is solved with an appropriate interactive method. In that way, the decision maker with domain expertise can augment information contained in the data and direct the solution process with oneâ€™s preferences. At the same time, the decision maker gains insight into the interdependencies and trade-offs among the conflicting objectives, and can get convinced of the quality of the most preferred solution. In addition, I give some examples of data-driven decision making problems. Finally, I give an overview of the modular, open-source software framework DESDEO containing different interactive methods.

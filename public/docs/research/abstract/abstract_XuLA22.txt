Grid-connected microgrids comprising renewable energy, energy storage systems and local load, play a vital role in decreasing the energy consumption of fossil diesel and greenhouse gas emissions. A distribution power network connecting several microgrids can promote more potent and reliable operations to enhance the security and privacy of the power system. However, the operation control for a multi-microgrid system is a big challenge. To design a multi-microgrid power system, an intelligent multi-microgrids energy management method is proposed based on the preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PMORL) techniques. The power system model can be divided into three layers: the consumer layer, the independent system operator layer, and the power grid layer. Each layer intends to maximize its benefit. The PMORL is proposed to lead to a Pareto optimal set for each object to achieve these objectives. A non-dominated solution is decided to execute a balanced plan not to favor any particular participant. The preference-based results show that the proposed method can effectively learn different preferences. The simulation outcomes confirm the performance of the PMORL and verify the viability of the proposed method.

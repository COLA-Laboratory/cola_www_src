      <description> TikZ is a powerful drawing package for academics who are using LaTeX for paper writing. Unlike other TeX packages, TikZ itself is really huge, its manual contains about 1100+ pages, 100+ chapters. Tens of other packages, and serveral GUI applications are based on TikZ.
Instead of being comprehensive, this page mainly aims to provide a curated list of awesome TikZ templates frequently used in our COLA laboratory.

      <description>Overleaf is a collaborative cloud-based LaTeX editor used for writing, editing and publishing scientific documents. In COLA laboratory, we use the Overleaf as the centralized place to manage our manuscripts. In order to make the projects be managed in an organized manner, a project is usually named as A_B_C.
 A: journal/conference name, e.g., TEVC/PPSN22 B: acronym of the algorithm, e.g., TBO2 C: first character of your name, e.</description>

      <description>Bibtex is a powerful tool to manage your references in scientific writing by using LaTeX. However, the bibtex sources can be messy in the wild. Here are some useful tips to prepare a beautiful and clean bibtex file.
 Instead of searching from Google, it might be more convenient to search the corresponding paper or author in DBLP. There is an option to choose the export record as the BibTeX.</description>

      <description>What is Academicons? #  Academicons is a specialist icon font for academics. It contains icons for websites and organisations related to academia that are often missing from mainstream font packages. It can be used by itself, but its primary purpose is to be used as a supplementary package alongside a larger icon set. Go here to view the full icon set along with instructions for their use.
Requesting new icons #  New icons can be requested by creating an issue here.</description>

      <description>EMOC stands for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization in C++ which is a framework for single-objective and multi-objective optimization.
For more information about installation and usage, please refer to the document site.
 Features #    Rich algorithms and problems
EMOC implemented about 30 algorithms and more than 80 test problems which both include single-objective and multi-objective types.
  Developed in C++ and Cross-platform
All the source code of EMOC are wrote in C++.</description>

      <description>IEEE CIS Task Force 12 #  Task Force on Decomposition-based Techniques in Evolutionary Computation Objectives #  As the name suggests, the basic idea of the decomposition-based technique is to transform the original complex problem into simplified subproblem(s) so as to facilitate the optimization. Decomposition-based techniques have been widely used for solving both single- and multi-objective optimization problems. More specifically, in single-objective optimization, especially for the large-scale scenarios, which consider a tremendous amount of decision variables, the decomposition-based technique contains three aspects: 1) analyzing and understanding the fitness landscape and modularity structure of the underlying problem; 2) decomposing the original complex problem into several loosely coupled or independent subproblems based on the learnt characteristics; 3) using a meta-heuristic to solve these subproblems in a sequential or concurrent manner.</description>
